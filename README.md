 
# Intel Image Classification Challenge

## Overview
The **Intel Image Classification Challenge** is a machine learning project aimed at classifying images into six distinct categories:

1. Sea
2. Street
3. Mountain
4. Glacier
5. Forest
6. Buildings

The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient model that can classify images into these categories, leveraging computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the Intel Image Classification dataset.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning or deep learning models for image classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measure model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Display training progress and evaluation results with plots.

## Dataset
The dataset contains labeled images organized into six categories. You can download the dataset from [Intel Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intel-image-classification.git
   cd intel-image-classification
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
  
4. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).
   - Extract and place the dataset in the `dataset/` directory.

## Usage
1. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Run the preprocessing script to normalize images and split the dataset if needed.

2. **Train the Model**:
   - Use the training script to train the model on the dataset.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python train.py
     ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Test the model's performance on the validation/test dataset.
   - View detailed metrics and confusion matrix plots.
